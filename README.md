# colab

This repositroy is currently used as backup for a colab project to develop a "proof of concept" for a lstm based classifier in keras. The aim of this classifier is to classify openAPI specification on two sets of labels previously created in another project. This is only a PoC and will be used in the design research conducted in my master thesis on RESTful web service discovery based on the [openAPI specification](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification).
